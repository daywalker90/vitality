# vitality 
Core lightning (CLN) plugin to watch channel health, gossip health and ping amboss for online status

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Building](#building)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Telegram](#telegram)
* [Options](#options)
* [Example](#example)

# Installation
For general plugin installation instructions see the plugins repo [README.md](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins/blob/master/README.md#Installation)

Release binaries for
* x86_64-linux
* armv7-linux (Raspberry Pi 32bit)
* aarch64-linux (Raspberry Pi 64bit)

can be found on the [release](https://github.com/daywalker90/vitality/releases) page. If you are unsure about your architecture you can run ``uname -m``.

They require ``glibc>=2.31``, which you can check with ``ldd --version``.

# Building
You can build the plugin yourself instead of using the release binaries.
First clone the repo:

``git clone https://github.com/daywalker90/vitality.git``

Install a recent rust version ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended) and in the ``vitality`` folder run:

``cargo build --release``

After that the binary will be here: ``target/release/vitality``

# Usage
You can configure what the plugin checks for and optionally get notified with the options below.

These have to be in the ``config`` file in your ``lightning-dir`` (usually ``~/.lightning/config`` or ``~/.lightning/<network>/config``). The plugin is unable to read configs somewhere else, e.g. ``/etc/lightningd/config`` or from the cli. If you specified a different config file for CLN with ``--conf``, you still need to put the ``vitality`` options in a file called ``config`` in the ``lightning-dir`` mentioned before.

:warning: Make sure the plugin starts with lightningd (either by setting ``plugin=/path/to/vitality`` or putting it/link it in the plugins folder). Otherwise you have to comment out the ``vitality-`` lines or lightningd will not start

The channel health checks happen 10 minutes after start of the plugin and then every hour, so we don't disconnect from peers more than once an hour.

This is a dynamic plugin that can be started/stopped independently of CLN.

# Telegram
How to configure telegram notifications:
* Write to the @BotFather to create a bot and get the bot token
* Write to your bot
* visit ``https://api.telegram.org/bot<bottoken>/getUpdates`` and replace ``<bottoken>`` with your bot token
* get the chatid(s) that belong(s) to your username(s)/group(s) from the messages you see
* set the options for token and chatid(s) with the options below

# How to set options
``vitality`` is a dynamic plugin with dynamic options, so you can start it after CLN is already running and modify it's options after the plugin is started. You have two different methods of setting the options:

1. When starting the plugin dynamically.

* Example: ``lightning-cli -k plugin subcommand=start plugin=/path/to/vitality vitality-expiring-htlcs=20``

2. Permanently saving them in the CLN config file. :warning:If you want to do this while CLN is running you must use [setconfig](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference/lightning-setconfig) instead of manually editing your config file! :warning:If you have options in the config file (either by manually editing it or by using the ``setconfig`` command) make sure the plugin will start automatically with CLN (include ``plugin=/path/to/vitality`` or have a symlink to ``vitality`` in your ``plugins`` folder). This is because CLN will refuse to start with config options that don't have a corresponding plugin loaded. :warning:If you edit your config file manually while CLN is running and a line changes their line number CLN will crash when you use the [setconfig](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference/lightning-setconfig) command, so better stick to ``setconfig`` only during CLN's uptime!

* Example: ``lightning-cli setconfig vitality-expiring-htlcs 20``

You can mix two methods and if you set the same option with different methods, it will pick the value from your most recently used method.

# Options
* ``vitality-amboss`` ``default: false`` enable/disable pinging amboss for online status. Settings for online status visibility on your amboss page is here: [amboss](https://amboss.space/settings?page=monitoring)  Grace period needs to be 15min or higher, since we send every 5 minutes
* ``vitality-expiring-htlcs`` ``default: 0`` (off) check channels for expiring htlcs (with less than X blocks remaining) and does a reconnect in hope of fix, also notifies you if configured
* ``vitality-watch-channels`` ``default: true`` check channels for lost state or errors in status and notifies you if configured
* ``vitality-watch-gossip`` ``default: false`` compare local channel info with local gossip info, checks for correct public and active values in gossip and missing gossip. Might get skipped if gossip content is low (e.g. lightningd deleted ``gossip.store`` or it got corrupted and is rebuilding). Does a reconnect in hope of fix and notifies you if configured
* ``vitality-telegram-token`` your telegram bot token
* ``vitality-telegram-usernames`` actually your chatid(s) with the telegram bot, you can specify multiple chatids as a comma-separated list
* ``vitality-smtp-username`` smtp username for email notifications
* ``vitality-smtp-password`` smtp password for email notifications
* ``vitality-smtp-server`` smtp server for email notifications
* ``vitality-smtp-port`` smtp server port for email notifications
* ``vitality-email-from`` email "from" field for email notifications
* ``vitality-email-to`` email to send to for email notifications

# Example
Example config with everything enabled, checking for htlcs that are closer than 50 blocks to expiry and notifications via telegram and email:
```
vitality-amboss=true
vitality-expiring-htlcs=50
vitality-watch-channels=true
vitality-watch-gossip=true
vitality-telegram-token=4582169472:Og4grGKROE3OR-x-O3kfOsks
vitality-telegram-usernames=936723718,936723363
